"""Sandbox primitives for sourcehunt and other source-code-aware agent flows.

Distinct from clearwing/agent/tools/kali_docker_tool.py — that tool is
attack-focused (approval gates, apt-get install, network access). The sandbox
primitives here are isolation-focused: no network, read-only mounts, resource
limits, and sanitizer-instrumented build images.
