"""Finding-reporting tool for the source-hunt hunter.

A single tool, `record_finding`, that the hunter calls to surface a
vulnerability into `ctx.findings`. This is where hunter-emitted hits
become `clearwing.findings.Finding` dataclass instances — the canonical
shape consumed by the sourcehunt verifier, exploiter, patcher, and
reporter stages downstream.
