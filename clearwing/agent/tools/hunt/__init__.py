"""Per-hunter ReAct tools for the source-hunt pipeline.

Public entry points:
- `HunterContext`                  — the mutable per-hunter state (sandbox,
                                      findings list, specialist, session_id).
- `build_hunter_tools(ctx)`        — the full 9-tool set for memory_safety /
                                      logic_auth / general specialists.
- `build_propagation_auditor_tools(ctx)` — the narrower Tier C subset that
                                      drops the sandboxed build+execute tools
                                      (compile/run/fuzz/write_test_case).

Internal layout:
    sandbox.py    — HunterContext dataclass + sanitizer-variant routing
    discovery.py  — read_source_file, list_source_tree, grep_source, find_callers
    analysis.py   — compile_file, run_with_sanitizer, write_test_case, fuzz_harness
    reporting.py  — record_finding

Phase 5a–d split these out of the 791-LOC hunter_tools.py god file.
The per-module `build_*_tools(ctx)` factories are composed here; the
exact tool order is preserved so the tool-registry snapshot test stays
green.

The underscore-prefixed helpers (`_normalize_path`, `_parse_rg_output`,
`_default_libfuzzer_template`, `_parse_sanitizer_report`,
`_parse_variant_arg`, etc.) are re-exported here for the handful of
test files that reach into them. Move them to tests/fixtures/ if the
test reach-ins ever become burdensome.
